I recently had the opportunity to learn how to design an interactive Excel dashboard under the guidance of Abdul Saad, where I explored data visualization and analysis using real-world healthcare metrics.

Here's what I learned and applied while building this dashboard:
ğŸ”¹ Patient Admission Status
ğŸ”¹ Patient Age Distribution
ğŸ”¹ Timeliness 
ğŸ”¹ Gender Analysis
ğŸ”¹ Department Referrals 
ğŸ”¹ Patient Satisfaction

This dashboard not only improved my Excel and data visualization skills but also deepened my understanding of how data can support better decision-making in healthcare.
